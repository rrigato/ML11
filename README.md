###Working with ntlk
The natural language toolkit library for python is kind of tricky.

After installing the module, import the library into a python interpruter session and run the following

```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```
You will be prompted to install some additional packages make sure you do so
Or else you will get a nasty resource error
